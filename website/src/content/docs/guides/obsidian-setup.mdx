Openza Tasks can extract tasks from your Obsidian vault by scanning markdown
checkboxes. The vault is never modified.

## Connect Your Vault

<Steps>
1. Open **Settings** in Openza Tasks
2. Select **Obsidian** in the sidebar
3. Click **Select Vault Folder**
4. Choose the root folder of your Obsidian vault
</Steps>

After connecting, click **Sync** in the navigation rail to extract tasks.

## Supported Task Format

Openza Tasks recognizes GitHub Flavored Markdown checkboxes:

```markdown
- [ ] Open task
- [x] Completed task
* [ ] Asterisk bullet
+ [ ] Plus bullet
```

Only lines with a checkbox and a non-empty title are imported.

## How Tasks Are Organized

- Tasks appear under the **Obsidian** provider in the Projects pane.
- The top-level vault folder becomes a virtual project name.
- Files in the vault root are grouped under **Vault Root**.
- Heading paths (e.g., `Project > Phase`) are stored for context.

## Behavior & Limits

<Aside type="note">
Obsidian extraction is one-way. Edits in Openza Tasks stay local, and your
vault files are never changed.
</Aside>

- **No write-back:** Changes made in Openza Tasks do not update your vault.
- **No deletions:** Removing a checkbox in Obsidian does not delete the task
  in the app. Delete locally if needed.
- **File scope:** Only `.md` files are scanned; hidden folders like `.obsidian`
  are skipped.
- **File size limit:** Files larger than 5 MB are ignored.

## Tips

- Re-run **Sync** after editing notes to pull new checkboxes.
- Keep headings consistent if you want tasks to stay grouped by section.
