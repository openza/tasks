## Troubleshooting

### "Tenant Not Allowed" Error

This can occur with some organizational accounts. Contact your IT administrator to allow third-party app access.

### Token Refresh Issues

If you're frequently being logged out:
1. Disconnect your account in Settings
2. Clear any cached data
3. Reconnect your Microsoft account

<Aside type="tip">
  Your tokens are stored securely in your system's secret storage service (e.g., GNOME Keyring, KWallet).
