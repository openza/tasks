# Configuration

Openza Tasks supports multiple task providers. You can connect one or more providers to sync your tasks.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Status | Auth Method |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Local Tasks | Fully Supported | N/A (offline) |
| Todoist | Fully Supported | API Token |
| Microsoft To-Do | Fully Supported | OAuth 2.0 |

## First Launch

When you first launch Openza Tasks, you can start using it immediately with local tasks. To sync with external providers, go to Settings to connect your accounts.

<Aside type="tip">
  Local tasks work completely offline and are stored on your device.
