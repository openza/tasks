Projects help you group related tasks together. Openza Tasks supports both local projects you create and read-only projects synced from external providers.

## Project Types

### Local Projects

Projects created in Openza Tasks that you fully control:

- Create, edit, and delete freely
- Assign any color from the palette
- Move tasks between them

### Provider Projects

Projects from Todoist or Microsoft To-Do appear in the sidebar automatically:

- **Read-only** - Cannot edit or delete from Openza Tasks
- Managed through the original provider
- Tasks synced from these projects show their source project

<Aside type="note">
Provider projects are extracted from your synced tasks. They appear once you have tasks from that provider.
</Aside>

### The Inbox

Every integration has a default Inbox project:

- Always exists and cannot be deleted
- Tasks without a project go here
- Cannot be renamed or edited

## Creating a Project

<Steps>
1. Click **Add Project** in the navigation rail
2. Enter a project name
3. Choose a color from the palette
4. Click **Create**
</Steps>

The new project appears in your Projects pane under the Openza Tasks section.

## Deleting a Project

<Steps>
1. Right-click the project or click the menu icon
2. Select **Delete**
3. Choose what to do with the tasks:

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
The context menu shows your 3 most recent projects for quick access. Select "More projects..." to see all available projects.
</Aside>

## Filtering by Project

Click any project in the Projects pane to filter the task list:

- Only tasks from that project are shown
- The project name appears in the header
- Click the project again or select another view to clear the filter

## Project Colors

When creating or editing a project, choose from 8 colors:

| Color | Use Case Example |
|-------|------------------|
| Gray | Archive or low-priority |
| Blue | Work projects |
| Green | Personal or health |
| Red | Urgent or important |
| Amber | Warnings or pending |
| Purple | Creative projects |
| Pink | Personal projects |
| Cyan | Learning or research |

Colors help you visually distinguish projects in the sidebar and on task cards.
