import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Import tasks directly from markdown files or pasted text using GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) checkbox syntax.

## Supported Format

Openza Tasks recognizes GFM task list syntax:

```markdown
- [ ] Open task (will be imported as active)
- [x] Completed task (will be imported as done)
```

### What Gets Imported

- **Task title** - The text after the checkbox
- **Completion status** - Based on `[ ]` (open) or `[x]` (completed)

<Aside type="note">
Priority, due dates, and labels are not imported from markdown. You can add these after import.

### Method 2: Import File

## Duplicate Detection

When importing, Openza Tasks checks for duplicate tasks:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Skip duplicates | Existing tasks are not modified |
| Create anyway | Import all tasks even if duplicates exist |

## Task Preview

Before importing, you'll see:
- List of all detected tasks
- Checkbox status (open/completed)
- Total count of tasks to import

<Aside type="tip">
Review the preview carefully before importing. You can go back and edit your markdown if needed.

## Safety Limits

To prevent issues with large files:

- **Maximum file size**: 5 MB
- **Maximum line length**: 10,000 characters
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 only

## Examples

### Simple Task List

```markdown
- [ ] Buy milk
- [ ] Call dentist
- [x] Pay bills
```

### Mixed Content (Only Checkboxes Imported)

```markdown
# Shopping List

## Groceries
- [ ] Eggs
- [ ] Bread
- [x] Butter

## Notes
This is just a note and won't be imported.
```

Only the items with `- [ ]` or `- [x]` prefix are imported as tasks.

## Use Cases

### From Meeting Notes
Copy action items from meeting notes directly into Openza Tasks.

### From Other Apps
Export tasks from another tool as markdown, then import here.

### Quick Entry
Write tasks in your favorite text editor, then import in bulk.
