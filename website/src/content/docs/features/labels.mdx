description: Categorize tasks with labels
---

Labels (called "tags" in some providers) allow you to categorize tasks across different projects.

## Viewing Labels

Access labels through:
- **Next Actions view** - Filter tasks by specific labels
- **Task details** - See all labels applied to a task
- **Sort by Label** - Group tasks by their labels in the task list

## Label Colors

Labels maintain their colors from your task provider:
- Todoist label colors are synced automatically
- Microsoft To-Do categories show their assigned colors

## Filtering by Label

When sorting tasks by label, the filter dropdown shows all available labels from your tasks. Select a label to show only tasks with that label applied.

See [Projects](/tasks/features/projects) for organizing tasks into project groups.
