# Labels & Projects

Openza Tasks helps you organize your work using labels and projects from your connected task providers.

## Labels

Labels (called "tags" in some providers) allow you to categorize tasks across different projects.

### Viewing Labels

Access labels through:
- **Next Actions view** - Filter tasks by specific labels
- **Task details** - See all labels applied to a task
- **Label filter** - Quick filter in the sidebar

### Label Colors

Labels maintain their colors from your task provider:
- Todoist label colors are synced automatically
- Microsoft To-Do categories will show their assigned colors

## Projects

Projects group related tasks together.

### Project Views

- See all projects in the sidebar
- Click a project to view its tasks
- Nested projects are supported (Todoist)

### Project Statistics

Each project shows:
- Task count
- Completion percentage
- Overdue task count

## Filtering

Combine labels and projects for powerful filtering:

```
Project: Work + Label: @urgent
```

This shows all urgent tasks in your Work project.
