description: Organize your tasks with labels and projects

Openza Tasks helps you organize your work using labels and projects from your connected task providers.

## Labels

Labels (called "tags" in some providers) allow you to categorize tasks across different projects.

### Viewing Labels

Access labels through:
- **Next Actions view** - Filter tasks by specific labels
- **Task details** - See all labels applied to a task

### Label Colors

Labels maintain their colors from your task provider:
- Todoist label colors are synced automatically
- Microsoft To-Do categories will show their assigned colors

## Projects

Projects group related tasks together.

### Project Views

- See all projects in the sidebar under "Projects"
- Click a project to view its tasks
- Nested projects are supported (Todoist)

### Creating Tasks in Projects

When creating a new task, you can assign it to a project from the task creation dialog.
