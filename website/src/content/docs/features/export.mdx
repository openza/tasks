import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Export all your tasks to a human-readable markdown file for archiving, sharing, or migrating to other tools.

## Export Format

Tasks are exported in organized markdown format:

- **Grouped by project** for easy navigation
- **Checkbox syntax** (`- [ ]` for open, `- [x]` for completed)
- **Task details** including priority, due dates, and labels
- **Separate sections** for projects and labels

### Example Output

```markdown
# Tasks Export

## Project: Work

- [ ] Review quarterly report
  - Priority: High
  - Due: 2025-01-15
  - Labels: work, urgent

- [x] Submit expense report
  - Priority: Medium
  - Completed

## Project: Personal

- [ ] Buy groceries
  - Labels: errands
```

## How to Export

<Steps>
1. Open **Settings** (gear icon in the navigation rail)
2. Go to the **Export** page
3. Review the preview showing your tasks
4. Click **Export to File**
5. Choose a save location and filename
</Steps>

## Export Preview

Before exporting, you'll see:

- **Statistics** - Total tasks, active/completed counts, projects, and labels
- **Preview** - First 50 lines of the export
- Full export is saved to your chosen file

<Aside type="tip">
The export preview helps you verify the content before saving. The full export may contain more data than shown in the preview.
</Aside>

## Use Cases

### Archiving
Create periodic exports to keep a readable history of your tasks outside the app.

### Sharing
Share task lists with team members who don't use Openza Tasks.

### Migration
Move your tasks to another tool that supports markdown import.

### Documentation
Include task lists in project documentation or reports.

## Notes

- Export includes all tasks (both local and synced)
- Completed tasks are included with `[x]` checkboxes
- File is saved with `.md` extension
- Export runs in the background without blocking the UI
