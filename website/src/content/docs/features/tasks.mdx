Tasks are the core of Openza Tasks. You can create local tasks or sync tasks from Todoist and Microsoft To-Do.

## Creating a Task

<Steps>
1. Click **Add Task** in the navigation rail
2. Enter a title (required)
3. Optionally set:
   - Description
   - Project (defaults to Inbox)
   - Priority (Urgent, High, Normal, Low)
   - Due date
   - Labels
4. Click **Add Task** or press Enter
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
Only local Openza Tasks projects and labels appear in the create dialog. To add tasks to Todoist or MS To-Do projects, create them in those apps and sync.
</Aside>

## Editing a Task

<Steps>
1. Click a task to open the details panel
2. Click the **pencil icon** to enter edit mode
3. Modify any fields
4. Click **Save** to apply changes, or **Cancel** to discard
</Steps>

If you have unsaved changes and try to cancel, a confirmation dialog appears.

### Editing Synced Tasks

<Aside type="note">
Tasks from Todoist, Microsoft To-Do, and Obsidian are editable in Openza Tasks. Edits to title,
description, due date, priority, labels, and local project assignments stay local.

For Todoist and Microsoft To-Do, **only completion syncs back**. For Obsidian, the vault is never
modified; re-sync to pull changes from your notes.
</Aside>

## Completing a Task

Complete a task in two ways:
- Click the **circular checkbox** on the task card or in the details panel
- Click the **Complete** button in the details panel footer

Completed tasks:
- Show strikethrough text
- Move to the Completed view
- Record a completion timestamp

### Reopening a Task

To reopen a completed task:
1. Go to the **Completed** view
2. Click the task to open details
3. Click **Reopen** in the footer

<Aside type="tip">
Completing or reopening synced tasks updates the original provider (Todoist/MS To-Do) on the next sync.
</Aside>

## Deleting a Task

<Steps>
1. Select the task to open details
2. Click **Delete** in the footer
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog
</Steps>

You can also right-click a task and select **Delete** from the context menu.

<Aside type="caution">
Deletion cannot be undone. For Todoist and Microsoft To-Do tasks, deletion also removes the task from
the original provider. For Obsidian tasks, deletion is local only and does not change your vault.
</Aside>
