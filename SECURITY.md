# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest release and the current main branch. If you find an issue in an older version, please verify it still reproduces on the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports.

Preferred: open a private GitHub Security Advisory on this repository.

If you cannot use GitHub advisories, contact the maintainer listed in the README/CLAUDE.md with a private message and include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix and release.
